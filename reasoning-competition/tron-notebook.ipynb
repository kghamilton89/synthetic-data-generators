    "# To Reason or Not?\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRON notebook is a pipeline to generate synthetic data for the To Reason or Not (TRON) Dataset. Reasoning models are token-heavy and compute-heavy. What if we could create an agentic pipeline that leveraged a Reasoning Agent who would quickly determine whether or not the user's query was complex enough to justify a more thorough reasoning task?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/tron-arch.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a case where the underlying model of the TRON-trained agent were to be restricted to a finite token limit to determine whether or not a more expensive reasoning transaction was necessary to sufficiently respond to the input prompt and the downstream response generation agents were given a more liberal allocation, because the user could be sure that only meritous tasks were reaching it. The TRON-trained agent could be taught to support an arbitrary number of downstream response agents as well, making the implications of such an agent very beneficial to research fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, this architecture shifts the burden of the resource allocation to the agentic model system itself rather than the user. An inexperienced, programmatic, or high-frequency user may not have the time or knowledge to individually assess the proper model type to use, thus exposing themselves to unnessesary token consumption. The TRON architecture has potential to help startups use their limited resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TRON Dataset is a step towards the reality visualized and discribed above and represents a tangible step forward to productive, safe, and user-oriented AI systems. TRON can be used to fine tine a reasoning model to quickly reason through whether or not it makes sense to invest in a full reasoning task or a simple LLM completion task makes more sense."
